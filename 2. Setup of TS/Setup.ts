/**
 * The following tools you need to set up to start with TypeScript:
=> Node.js – Node.js is the environment in which you will run the TypeScript compiler. Note that you  don’t need to know node.js.
=> TypeScript compiler – a Node.js module that compiles TypeScript into JavaScript.
=> Visual Studio Code or VS Code – a code editor supporting TypeScript. VS Code is highly recommended. However, you can use your favorite editor.
 */

/**
 * 1) At first we have to install Node.js from official website and check version by: node -v.
 * 2) To install the TypeScript compiler, you launch the Terminal on macOS or Linux and Command Prompt on Windows and type the following command: npm install -g typescript and check version by: tsc --v. Then install module by command: npm install -g ts-node.
 * 3) Install VS Code and download Live server extension.
