/**
 * What is Type Script..?
 */

/**
 * TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript.
    TypeScript builds on top of JavaScript. First, you write the TypeScript code. Then, you compile the TypeScript code into plain JavaScript code using a TypeScript compiler.
    Once you have the plain JavaScript code, you can deploy it to any environment that JavaScript runs.
 */

/**
 * TypeScript uses the JavaScript syntaxes and adds additional syntaxes for supporting Types.
    If you have a JavaScript program that doesn’t have any syntax errors, it is also a TypeScript program. It means that all JavaScript programs are TypeScript programs. This is very helpful if you’re migrating an existing JavaScript codebase to TypeScript.
 */

/**
 * Why Type Script..?
 */

/**
 * The main goals of TypeScript are:
    1) Introduce optional types to JavaScript.
    2) Implement planned features of future JavaScript, a.k.a. ECMAScript Next or ES Next to the current  JavaScript.
 */

/**
 * Feauters of Type Script
 */

/**
 * 1) TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript.
 * 2) TypeScript adds type to the JavaScript and helps you avoid potential bugs that occur at runtime.
 * 3) TypeScript also implements the future features of JavaScript.
